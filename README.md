Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide, killing an estimated 17.9 million people each year, accounting for 31% of all fatalities. Heart attacks and strokes account for four out of every five CVD fatalities, with one-third of these deaths occurring before the age of 70. CVDs are a common cause of heart failure, and this dataset contains 11 variables that can be used to predict heart disease.
This project analyzes this data.
