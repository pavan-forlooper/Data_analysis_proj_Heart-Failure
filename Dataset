This dataset was developed by integrating other datasets that were previously accessible but had not been merged. This dataset combines five heart datasets with 11 shared characteristics to provide the biggest heart disease dataset available for research purposes to date. The following five datasets were utilised in its curation:

303 observations in Cleveland
294 observations in Hungarian
123 observations from Switzerland
200 observations in Long Beach, Virginia
270 observations in the Stalog (Heart) data set

There were 1190 observations in all.
272 observations were duplicated.
918 observations in the final dataset
